# Svelte scaffold with bulma and easyroute

This repo serves as reference for hot to steup a simple [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) app* that includes [Svelte Easyroute](https://lyoha.info/en/projects/svelterouter) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/).
**This app uses webpack not rollup*

Used as is, it should provide a good scaffold for front-end driven apps with client-side routing without the need for a backend. 

## Deploying and reproducing from scratch
